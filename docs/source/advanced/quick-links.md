# Quick Links

Campaigns can have quick links, which are basically favourite pages in the campaign. By default, these are displayed in the campaign's sidebar after the dashboard.

To create a quick link, start by going to **QUICK LINKS** and click on the **New** button on the top right.

There are currently four different types of quick links. Ones that point to a specific entity, ones that point to a list of entities, ones that point to a random entity, and ones that point to a dashboard.

## Entity

This quick link points to a specific entity. Select an existing entity from the list, and an optional subpage the link should point to (for example an entity's attributes).

Note that if the entity can't be seen by a user, the link won't appear in the quick links.

## Entity list

This quick link points to a list of entities, for example a list of characters. You can combine this with filters, to for example only show characters who are dead, or who have a specific tag.

The nested field controls if the link forces the page's nested more. This is only useful for entities which have a parent (ie locations).

## Random

To replicate a wiki's random page link, use this option to open a random entity of the campaign each time the link is clicked. You can limit the kind of entity selected, and also include filters. For example, if you have a To-Do tag in your campaign, you can open a random entity that you've marked as needing more work.

## Dashboard

If have have a [boosted campaigns](https://kanka.io/en-US/boosters), you can point the quick link to a specific dashboard of the campaign.
