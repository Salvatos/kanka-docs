# Birth, Death, Foundation

Characters, Locations, Families and Organisations all have a special type of [reminder](features/reminders). When creating a reminder in those entities' reminders subpage, the reminder has an **event type** field.

## Characters

Characters have the option of birth and death. If just a birth is provided, the entity's [profile sidebar](features/profile-sidebar) will be populated with the date of birth and a calculated age based on the calendar's current date.

If both a birth and death reminder is set, it will calculate the age at death of the character in the profile sidebar.

## Locations, Families, Organisations

These entities have a **founded** option, which if set, displays the entity's foundation date and current age in the profile sidebar.
