[![A short introduction video to Kanka and what it does.](https://img.youtube.com/vi/z4W5m9hmfUQ/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/z4W5m9hmfUQ)

## Account

Your first steps to using Kanka is to register a free account and log in. You can register using an email and password, or using your Google, Twitter or Facebook accounts. 

If you choose to use a third party provider, you can switch to a custom password later in your profile settings.

Creating your account automatically logs you in and creates your first campaign for you.

## Campaign Dashboard

The default page that loads up when calling Kanka is your campaign dashboard. By default, this is empty, but you can set it up to show useful things like recently modified entities, or pin specific entities on it.
