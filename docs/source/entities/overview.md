# Entities

You might be familiar with the concept of an article in traditional wiki software. Rather than everything being a generic article in Kanka, your worlds and campaigns are split up into precisely defined types. We call the generic article concept an **entity**. 

Every character, family, location, map, quest is an entity, but each has their own unique features and way to display data and allow you to interact with it.

The types of entities is hard-coded into Kanka, so adding your own types isn't possible. We do this to allow each type to feel unique and have its own feature that interact with the rest of the world. This also avoids the traditional issue of note-taking software or being too ill-defined, leading to spending more time setting up your hierarchy rather than focusing on building your world.
