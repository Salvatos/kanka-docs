# Characters

Characters are the most used entity type in Kanka, and for good reason. A world needs things in it to feel alive! Characters represent the people living in your world, basically anything with a consciousness than can have agency.

We typically recommend having deities as characters in your world, to benefit from the available features of the character entity type.

## Building a character

Let's focus on creating a character, but keep in mind that most of the steps here apply for all other entity types as well.

From your campaign's sidebar, click on **Characters**, this brings you to the list of all characters of the campaign. On the top right, click on the **New** button. This will bring you to the character creation form.

Characters come with a bunch of pre-defined fields. Only the name is mandatory, but we'll quickly go other the various fields.

### Tabs

To keep the forms from being overwhelming, they are split up into several tabs.

#### Entry tab

The entry tab contains the description of the character.

* **Name**: the name of your character. This will be used for search and mentioning entities. If a character with a similar name already exists, a warning will appear below the name field.

* **Type**: this text field can contain anything you want to help you distinguish between various characters. A common example is writing a character's occupation.

* **Title**: a character's title is displayed on the character's page. This text field can be an honorific title.

Next up are foreign fields. Foreign fields are other entities in the campaign, and a way to interconnect the character with your world.

* **Family**: the character's family. Note that only a single family can be selected.
* **Location**: where the character is currently located. If filled in, this will show up in the location's characters subpage.
* **Races**: the various races or kin of the character. A character can have multiple races.

Next up is the Entry, this is where the character's story or description is written.

* **Age**: this text field allows both numbers and text (like very old).
* **Gender**: the character's gender. Note that this field will suggest the 10 most used genders of your campaign as your campaign becomes more populated and diverse.
* **Pronouns**: similar to the gender field, the 10 most used pronouns will be suggested for this field.

If the character is **dead**, you can select that option. This will add a small skull icon to the character's name in various lists and interfaces.

At the bottom, we have tags. This is to categorise your character to be able to quickly find similar characters in the future (for example player characters, warlocks, bbegs).

Next up, the character's image. You can either select an image from your device, or input the URL of a website, and Kanka will try and download the image and attach it to the character.

And lastly, for members of the campaign's admin role, the Privacy field. Is selected, this character won't be visible to members of the campaign outside of its admin role.


#### Traits

In this interface, you can add descriptions to the character's physically appearance and personality traits. You have the option of pinning either all appearances or personality traits, making them visible on the character's overview page.

By default, the Personality visible option is checked. If unchecked, the character's personality will only be visible to the campaign's admin role members.
Organisations

If this is your first character, you might not yet have organisations. You can create one on the fly, or come back to this interface later. This allows you to make this character a member of one or several organisations of your world.

#### Organisations

This tab allows to control in which organisations the character is a member of.

#### Boosts

This tab is only available to [boosted Campaigns](https://kanka.io/en-US/boosters).

These fields include

* **Tooltip**: Instead of having the character's entry field be trimmed down for the tooltip when hovering its name, use this field to define exactly what is shown in the tooltip.
* **Header image**: A header image is an image displayed behind the character's image, name, and info like tags and title displayed at the top of the character's page.
* **Gallery image**: Instead of uploading an image to the character, select an image from the gallery.

#### Attributes

Attributes are values attached to your character. Think HP, level, and more. Learn more about [attributes](features/attributes).

#### Permissions

The last tab is about permissions. We go over this in more detail on our [permissions](features/permissions) page
