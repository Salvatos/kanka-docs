# Notes

The catch-all for anything that doesn't belong in the other entity types. Notes can be _nested_ (have a parent note) and be tagged, so combining that and [quick links](features/quick-links), you can create your own new section.

* **Lore** -> notes
* **Recipes** -> notes
* **Todos** -> notes
* **Plots** -> notes
* **Everything else** -> Kanka
