# Tags

The bestest module of Kanka. Tag everything. Tag freely. If you're scared of losing track of something you've created, tag it. 

## Auto-applying tags

Tags can be set to **automatically apply** to new entities, so all your new entities can have a **STUB** tag until you've filled out their backstory and found their purpose in your story. This option is available when creating or editing a tag.
