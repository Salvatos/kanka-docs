# Abilities

A way to build the **powers** of your characters. Think of it as the magic system of your world.

Abilities can be added to any entity type. The most obvious is characters having the power to cast fireball. It can also be an organisation granting a dark power to its members, a location's _lair actions_, an item's granted power, a family's curse, etc.
