# Races

The badly named **races** module is a way to represent sci-fi and fantasy races of the characters of your world. If your world just has cyborg-gnomes, you can [disable the module](features/campaigns/modules).

## Example

In a typical fantasy setting, you might have Elves, Hobbits, Dragons and Humans as humans. You can go into detail and create child-races to elves, for example *wood elves*, whose parent race would be *elf*.
