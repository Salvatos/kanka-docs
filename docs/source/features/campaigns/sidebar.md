# Sidebar

[Boosted campaigns](https://kanka.io/en-US/boosters) can customise their sidebars. To do so, go to **World** and **Sidebar setup**.

In this interface, you can reorder elements of the sidebar, change their icons, as well as their labels. These change effect all users of the campaign and in all languages. The custom names aren't reflected in the rest of the application.

When reordering elements of the sidebar, you cannot for example put Quick Links inside another element. You can however make Conversations as the first element of the sidebar, if you so wish.
