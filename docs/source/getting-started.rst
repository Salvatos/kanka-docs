Account
------------

To use Kanka, you first need to register an account. You can either use an email and password combination, or use a third-party service like Facebook, Twitter, or Google.

Creating your account automatically logs you in and creates your first campaign for you.

Basic terminology
----------------

Kanka uses the word **campaign** to organise your content. Think of it as your *world*, or your *project*. Most of the time in Kanka will be spent looking at contents of a single campaign.

Every campaign is then populated into what we call **entities**. Entities are your characters, locations, items, calendars, maps, and other elements that build up your world.
