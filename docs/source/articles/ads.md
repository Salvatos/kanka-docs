# Ads

For our Kobolds (free users), ads are displayed throughout the campaign pages in Kanka. These ads are a list of ads based on your browsing experience, and third-party products and services in the general TTRPG (Tabletop Role Playing Game) space.

## Disabling ads

Ads can be disabled by [subscribing to Kanka](https://kanka.io/en-US/pricing) on any of the tiers. As long as your subscription is active, you won't see any ads while browsing Kanka.

## Boosted campaigns

[Boosting a campaign](https://kanka.io/en-US/boosters) disables ads for any **logged in user** viewing the campaign. A user that is not logged in will still be shown ads when viewing a boosted campaign.
